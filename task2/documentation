the class calc includes the calculation functions.
we know that work done on an object is the amount of force on over a distance, i.e. work done  = force x distance

So the function work_done takes two values force on the object and how long the force was applied for.
The output of the function gives the amount of work done on that object.
work_done takes two float and outputs a float.

uses: work(float) = calc.work_done(force(float), distance(float));

Now according to work energy theorem the change kinetic energy of the body is equal to the work done on it.
So the function change_in_kinetic has the same internal logic.
This function calculates the change in kinetic energy of that object while it a force was acting on it.

uses: delta_KE(float) = calc.change_in_kinetic(force(float), distance(float));
