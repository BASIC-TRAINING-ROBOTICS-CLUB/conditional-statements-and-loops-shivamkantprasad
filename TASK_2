Work-Energy Theorem Calculator

Task: Write a program to compute the work done on an object and its corresponding change in kinetic energy. 
Use the work-energy theorem to validate the results with different forces and distances.

Develop a library that incoorporates the necessary functions or classes to perform essential calculations required by users. 
Also submit a document file about the things you learned while doing the task( be it mathematics, logic or even code syntax ).

Documentation is mandatory regardless of whether the task is completed.If the task is not completed, provide a detailed explanation of the technical 
reasons or challenges that prevented its completion.
